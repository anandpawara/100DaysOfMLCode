# 100 Days Of ML Code 





### Day 1: 18 March 2019

**Today's Progress**:Deployed first SMS spam detector ML flask app on Heroku.


**Thoughts** : Finally after fidgeting with Heroku deployed on Heroku server

### Day 2-5: 23 March 2019

**Today's Progress**:After many bug fixes updated code as per latest python3.7 version and deployed on Heroku as well


**Thoughts** : Project is working as per expected need further to research to load model from custom trained model rather than pre trained model.

### Day 6-11: 29 March 2019

**Today's Progress**:

Worked on Reinforcement Learning to train play mario on gym retro using NEAT algorithm

Had worked on dog breed classifier to predict dog breed using flask rest api 


**Thoughts** : 

Learning Reinforcement algorithms is fun and but need lot troubleshooting to run nes files for games and need setup environment
