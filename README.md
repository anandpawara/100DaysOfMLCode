# 100 Days Of ML Code 





### Day 1: 18 March 2019

**Today's Progress**:Deployed first SMS spam detector ML flask app on Heroku.


**Thoughts** : Finally after fidgeting with Heroku deployed on Heroku server

### Day 2-5: 23 March 2019

**Today's Progress**:After many bug fixes updated code as per latest python3.7 version and deployed on Heroku as well


**Thoughts** : Project is working as per expected need further to research to load model from custom trained model rather than pre trained model.

### Day 6-11: 29 March 2019

**Today's Progress**:

Worked on Reinforcement Learning to train play mario on gym retro using NEAT algorithm

Had worked on dog breed classifier to predict dog breed using flask rest api 


**Thoughts** : 

Learning Reinforcement algorithms is fun and but need lot troubleshooting to run nes files for games and need setup environment

### Day 12-13: 30-31 March 2019

**Today's Progress**:
1.Updated Digit recognizer flaskapp to load custom model build from scrath in keras 

2.Learned on loading and saving model and image preprocessing using for predict() method

3.Pushed marai project on git Neat algorithm to play mario game  

**Thoughts** :

1.Marai was fun to code needs more training and further try to implement DQN algorithm

2.Working to flaskapp to recognize handwritthen characters and fine tuning to digit recognition

### Day 14-17: 4 April 2019

**Today's Progress**:Deployed character and digit recognizer


**Thoughts** : Deployed web app for recognizing handwritten digits and characters

### Day 18-21: 12 April 2019

**Today's Progress**:Learned about Transfer learning tried to use moble net using transer learning but found that image size for emnist dataset is small and also tried resizing image but found out that it is accuracy decreased than before
Worked on frontend for the project

**Thoughts** :Transfer Learning is effective tool for quick prototype to achieve good results

### Day 22: 30 April 2019

**Today's Progress**:Started working on kaggle airbus ship detection challenge .Gone through various kernels trying to understand U-net model and trying to implement on local machines

**Thoughts** :Trying to understand run length encoding and data visualization as well

### Day 23: 1 May 2019

**Today's Progress**:Gone through kernel on kaggle also trying to understand U-net model ,run length encoding/decoding as well as data processing.Learned about submitting submission on kaggle

**Thoughts** :Data preprocssing seems difficult and rle decoding also took some to understand code
